so, the point of this project is to run it in a pair of phases.

it will run a stream, repeating a video over and over on the route. You'll need to check the code again to know the right route.

In order to run this correctly, in one terminal, run:
```
mediamtx
```

in another terminal, run:

```
go run main.go
```
